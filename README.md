# Potato-Leaves-Disease-Classification
A Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) project for classifying diseases in potato leaves. This project leverages advanced algorithms to accurately identify and classify various diseases based on leaf images.
## Objective
The primary goal is to develop a system capable of detecting and classifying common diseases in potato leaves to aid farmers and agriculturists in early diagnosis and effective management.
## Features
### Image Classification:
Classify potato leaf images into categories like healthy, early blight, and late blight.

### Deep Learning Models: 
Utilize state-of-the-art neural networks for high accuracy.

### User-Friendly Interface:
Potential integration of a web or mobile app for ease of use.

### Scalable:
Can be expanded to include more crops and diseases.
## Technologies Used
### Machine Learning Frameworks:
Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch

### Data Processing:
OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

### Visualization:
Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Dataset:
Potato leaves dataset from Kaggle.
## Dataset
Provide details about the dataset:

Source: Mention the dataset source or link (if publicly available).

Structure: Explain the dataset's structure, including the number of images and categories.

Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and preprocess the dataset.
